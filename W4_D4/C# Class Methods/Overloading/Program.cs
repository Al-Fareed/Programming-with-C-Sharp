Overloading

Write a program to calculate the cost of the stall based on its type. If the stall type is Gold, the cost will be Rs.100 per square feet. If the stall type is Diamond, the cost will be Rs.150 per square feet and cost of a TV will be Rs.100. If the stall type is Platinum, the cost will be Rs.200 per square feet and if they are using projector it will cost Rs.1000.

The 3 stall types are,

Gold
Diamond
Platinum
[Note :  Strictly adhere to the object-oriented specifications given as a part of the problem statement.
Follow the naming conventions as mentioned. Create separate classes in separate files.]

Consider the class named Stall and create the following methods.
Note: Use Overloading concept to define the ComputeCost method.

Method Name	Method Argument Type	Description
ComputeCost	string, int	The order of the parameters are stallType, squareFeet. This method is used to calculate the cost of the Gold stall on cost of Rs.100 per square feet.
ComputeCost	string, int, int	The order of the parameters are stallType, squareFeet, numberOfTV. This method is used to calculate the cost of the Diamond stall on cost of Rs.150 per square feet and cost per TV of Rs.100.
ComputeCost	string, int, bool	The order of the parameters are stallType, squareFeet, projectorAvailability. This method is used to calculate the cost of the Platinum stall on cost of Rs.200 per square feet and if they are using projector it costs Rs.1000.

Consider the class Program and write a Main method to test the above class.

In Main method, get the stall type and its corresponding stall details from the user and calculate the cost.
