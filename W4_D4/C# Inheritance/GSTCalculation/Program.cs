GST Calculation

Write a program to calculate the total amount with GST for the events. There are two types of Events Stage show and Exhibition. For Stage show GST will be 15% and for exhibition GST will be 5%.

 

[Note :  Strictly adhere to the object-oriented specifications given as a part of the problem statement.
Follow the naming conventions as mentioned. Create separate classes in separate files.]

Consider a class names Event with the following protected attributes.

Data Type	Attributes
string	_name
string	_type
double	_costPerDay
int	_noOfDays
Include default and parameterized constructor for the class.
Prototype for the Parameterized Constructor Event(string _name, string _type, double _costPerDay, int _noOfDays)

Consider the class Exhibition which inherits the Event class with the following private attributes.

Data Type	Attributes
static int	_gst = 5
int	_noOfStalls
Include default and parameterized constructor for the class.
Prototype for the Parameterized Constructor Exhibition(string _name, string _type, double _costPerDay, int _noOfDays, int _noOfStalls)

Define the following method in the Exhibition class.

Method	Description
public double totalCost()	This method is to calculate the total amount with 5% GST.

Consider the class StageEvent which inherits the Event class with the following private attributes.
Data Type	Attributes
static int	_gst = 15
int	_noOfSeats
Include default and parameterized constructor for the class.
Prototype for the Parameterized Constructor StageEvent(string _name, string _type, double _costPerDay, int _noOfDays, int _noOfSeats)

Define the following method in the StageEvent class.

Method	Description
public double totalCost()	This method is to calculate the total amount with 15% GST.

Use base() to call and assign values in base class constructor.
Override ToString() method to display the event details and the total amount inside this ToString() method.

Create Program class with Main method.
In the Main() method, read the event details from the user and then create the object of the event according to the event type. Display the statement ‘Event Details’ inside the Main() method.
